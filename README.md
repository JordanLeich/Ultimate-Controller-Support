## Important Notes üìì
- The UCS has nothing to do with bluetooth or not, or if your controller works on the PC or in the game. For the UCS to work, your controller MUST have been recognized by the game before.
- When playing coop mode, it is best to have all players to first connect their controllers, and select them in the game (if not done already by playing together in a previous session). Then, run the Easy Install.bat file.
- Switch to manual in controller configuration setting in MUA options if the configuration is set to automatic and doesn't work properly.
- Switch to automatic if using a standard layout setup (genuine Xbox 360 controller or 360 emu) or if manual doesn't work for you.
- Low resolutions (640x480, 800x600) are not fully supported.
- For other languages (Italian/Fullkeyset_ita) edit Easy Install.bat and change the `lang=eng` setting in the top section.
- If Easy Install.bat doesnt open for you or isnt working properly, try using the file called Add required system environment variables.bat found in the tools folder. Then rerun Easy Install.bat.
- Easy Install.bat cannot work with protected folders in Windows, those folders include: C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86), C:\Windows, C:\Windows\System32, C:\Users<YourUsername>\AppData, C:\ProgramData, and C:\Windows\System
