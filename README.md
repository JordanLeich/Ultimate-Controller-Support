## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Troubleshooting  
Ultimate Controller Support (UCS) enhances controller textures and configurations, but **it does not guarantee plug-and-play controller recognition**. The game itself must already recognize your controller. UCS only modifies textures and configuration files‚Äîit does **not** handle:  
- Bluetooth connectivity  
- Drivers or third-party controller tools  
- Steam Controller configurations  

### Before You Start  
- **Controller Recognition:** Your controller must already work in-game before UCS can apply textures. Prior to starting the game, check if your controller is recognized [here](https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad).
- **Co-op Play:** All players should connect their controllers and select them in-game (or from a previous session) *before* running `Easy Install.bat`.  
- **Configuration Settings:**  
  - Switch to **Manual** in the MUA options if Automatic doesn‚Äôt work.  
  - Use **Automatic** if you‚Äôre using a standard Xbox 360 layout or if Manual fails.  
- **Low Resolutions:** 640√ó480 and 800√ó600 are not fully supported.  
- **Language Support:** To use other languages (e.g., Italian), edit `Easy Install.bat` and change the `lang=eng` setting at the top.  
- **Windows Protected Folders:** Easy Install cannot run from protected windows directories such as:  
C:\Program Files
C:\Program Files (x86)
C:\Windows
C:\Users<YourUsername>\AppData
C:\ProgramData

- **Environment Variables:** If Easy Install won‚Äôt open, run `Add required system environment variables.bat` (found in the `tools` folder), then retry Easy Install.

### Getting Controller Icons to Work  
If your controller icons still don‚Äôt display correctly, it‚Äôs up to **you** to troubleshoot drivers, Steam configs, or third-party tools. UCS can assist by providing texture files, but **you may need to adjust Steam controller settings, update drivers, or use other utilities** to achieve proper icon display.
