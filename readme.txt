--- Mod Organizer 2 Installation --- 
1. Extract the Ultimate Controller Support rar file wherever you like.
2. Open the EasyInstall.bat file and follow the prompts accordingly. You can paste a MO2 mod folder when installing textures.
3. Open the Mod Organizer 2 Install Method folder and find the .rar file for the textures of the controller type you want. Install that .rar file into MO2. You can skip this step if using EasyInstall.bat worked for you.

--- Important Notes ---
- When playing coop mode, it is best to have all players to first connect their controllers, and select them in the game (if not done already by playing together in a previous session). Then, run the EasyInstall.bat file.
- Switch to manual in controller configuration setting in MUA options if the configuration is set to automatic and doesn't work properly.
- Switch to automatic if using a standard layout setup (genuine Xbox 360 controller or 360 emu) or if manual doesn't work for you.
- Low resolutions (640x480, 800x600) are not fully supported.
- Italian language (Fullkeyset_ita) is not supported.
